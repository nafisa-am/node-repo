# TDD

## Demo

* Explain TDD
  * Pull up Week 9 algorithm 1. Notice that tests were written for us before we wrote the code.
  * Write minimal test code that fails
  * Write minimal prod code that passes
  * Repeat forever

* Why use TDD?
  * Reduce bugs
  * Debugging is easier
  * code quality

* Open [11-Ins_TDD/package.json](../activities/11-Ins_TDD/package.json)
  * `jest` dependency
  * Note it's a dev dependency
  * `jest` in the test script
  * `npm test`
* Open [11-Ins_TDD/test/arithmetic.test.js](../activities/11-Ins_TDD/test/arithmetic.test.js)
  * Compare to instructor's standard approach of `console.log` test data

* Open [13-Ins_Pass-Tests/tests/fizz.test.js](../activities/13-Ins_Pass-Tests/tests/fizz.test.js)
  * Notice the continuous watching
* Look at [jest's website](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
